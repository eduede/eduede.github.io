							<h1>Research Projects</h1>
							<p class="major">At the University of Chicago, my work is focussed on accelarating science through simplifying and streamlining access to computational infrastructure.
                              Since the <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-chips-are-down-for-moore-s-law-1.19338">plateauing</a> of single core performance, exploiting parallelism is crucial to keep up with computing demands.
                              To this end, I've explored parallel programming models, high-performance distributed systems and marrying the two through Python based libraries.
                              A curated set of projects that fit this theme follow.

						<p class="major"><b>The Science and Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence</b></a></p>
						<p>This course will focus on the science, philosophy, and history of the development of AI from the cybernetics movement, to logic and expert systems GOFI period, recommender systems and deep neural networks (both in their initial and contemporary manifestations). Students will learn how these systems actually work, what tasks they were envisioned to be useful for, and what a study of these systems was and is thought to tell us about cognition, intelligence, and the world. In parallel, students will engage with literature in the philosophy of AI that seeks to interpret and challenge the science and rationale of these systems as well as ask and attempt to answer novel questions concerning the epistemology of deep neural networks. Students will also engage directly and philosophically with actual scientific literature that uses artificial intelligence.</p>
