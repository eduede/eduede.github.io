							<h1>Research Projects</h1>
							<p class="major">At the University of Chicago, my work is focussed on accelarating science through simplifying and streamlining access to computational infrastructure.
                              Since the <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-chips-are-down-for-moore-s-law-1.19338">plateauing</a> of single core performance, exploiting parallelism is crucial to keep up with computing demands.
                              To this end, I've explored parallel programming models, high-performance distributed systems and marrying the two through Python based libraries.
                              A curated set of projects that fit this theme follow.

						<p class="major"><b>Philosophy of Science and Artificial Intelligence</b></a></p>
						<p>My theoretical work in the philosophy of artificial intelligence is informed by both the philosophy of science and a rigorous, technical engagement with the contemporary AI research literature.
						In my philosophical work, I analyze how these tools can be understood to give us knowledge and how these tools are situated within the methodological landscape of science. My current projects focus on the nature of
					distributed representations and how these can and cannot serve as scientific representations. In the ethics of AI, I focus on bias, but also on questions
				concerned with the need for disciplinary integration in AI systems development.</p>

						<p class="major"><b>Computational Social Science</a></b></p>
						 <p>My empirical work in the computational social sciences is concerned with the dynamics of discovery across disciplines, geographic space, and time. My approach applies
						 contemporary AI methods for NLP (vector space embedding) and prediction (deep neural networks) as well as computational, statistical analysis to large scale observational data and
					 field experiments. I regularly collaborate with applied and basic scientists, social scientists, humanists, as well as industry professionals. My publications have been featured on CNN, in Scientific
				 American, MIT Technology Review, Harvard Business Review, Forbes, and elsewhere.</p>

							<p><b>Latent Knowledge Capture on Covid-19 Literature</b><br>
							As the published (and preprint) literature on Covid-19 explodes, no individual researcher, team, or institution can cognitively process and understand what we now collectively know about this disease. Many connections and relationships between and across properties of the virus, its interaction with hosts, its transmission within populations, as well as health and economic outcomes are missed precisely because the expertise needed to make these connections spans otherwise disparate and cognitively disjoint disciplines (microbiology, virology, epidemiology, medicine, and public policy). As a result, we may know more about this disease than we are collectively aware. As the number of these “unknown knowns” piles up, we are missing opportunities for breakthroughs. This suggests the need for computational approaches to reveal the correlations latent in our collective understanding. However, because that understanding is codified as text (as opposed to, say, structured data), it lacks the kind of statistical tractability necessary for traditional machine learning approaches to modeling. Here I propose to develop novel unsupervised word embedding models to capture and extract knowledge about Covid-19 that is otherwise latent in and across the blooming literature.<br></p>

							<p><b>When Technology Transforms Society: Considering the Societal and Ethical Impacts of Quantum Computing and AI</b>
							Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are currently making significant technical progress,
								with commensurate interest from the public, media outlets, funding agencies, and corporate partners.
								Stakeholders frequently point to the potential of these technologies to “transform society,” but what does this mean,
								practically? Should we, as researchers, anticipate the social, political, and ethical consequences of our work
								and steer our research programs accordingly? Can we draw from scholarship in the social sciences and the humanities
								to inform understanding of the distributional impacts of our programs? This workshop will explore these questions
								and develop collaborations across disciplines, institutions, and key stakeholders who may be able to help responsibly
								steer the evolution of these revolutionary technologies in ethical and socially beneficial ways.</p>
