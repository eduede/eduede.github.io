							<h1>Research Projects</h1>
							<p class="major">At the University of Chicago, my work is focussed on accelarating science through simplifying and streamlining access to computational infrastructure.
                              Since the <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-chips-are-down-for-moore-s-law-1.19338">plateauing</a> of single core performance, exploiting parallelism is crucial to keep up with computing demands.
                              To this end, I've explored parallel programming models, high-performance distributed systems and marrying the two through Python based libraries.
                              A curated set of projects that fit this theme follow.

						<p class="major">"Deep Neural Networks and the Philosophy of Science"</a><i><br><b>(Philosophy of Science)</b></br></i></p>
						This paper argues that deep neural networks (DNNs) present the philosophy of
science with novel epistemological problems. This is shown by demonstrating that
DNNs are neither constructed on the basis of, nor do we have good reason to
believe that they encode scientic theories. This characteristic in conjunction with
their uninterpretability distinguishes the concerns raised by DNNs from those
which have already been examined by the literatures on models, computational
science, and simulations. As a result of their novelty, our understanding of the
relationship between science and knowledge is shown to be threatened by the use
of DNNs in science.<b>(In Review)</b><br><i><b><u>Eamon Duede (UChicago)</u></i></b></p>



												<p class="major">"Abduction Through Social Syllogisms and the Logic of Scientific Advance"</a><i><br><b>(Philosophy of Science)</b></br></i></p>
												<p>Here we argue that the production of novel scientific claims through the process of abduction, the historical province of philosophy, represents a critical scientific practice, central to scientific success and failure, and increasingly available to science studies through large-scale data. We re-scale abduction to show how it necessarily occurs through conversation between those who understand a particular
													scientific system and its anomalies—its priests—and those exposed to alien and disruptive patterns, theories,
													and findings that could resolve them—its prophets. We argue that these complex, extended conversations between
													those with divergent backgrounds define a social logic of discovery that yield speculative hypotheses with
													outsized impact across science.<br><i><b><u>Eamon Duede (UChicago)</u></b> and James Evans (UChicago)</i></p>

													<p class="major">"Distance Matters in Science and Scholarship"</a><i><br><b>(Science of Science)</br></b></i></p>
													<p>The effect of spatial distance on scientific discovery and innovation is a highly important policy
														issue. Yet, there is still significant debate concerning how space affects science. Ubiquitous
														digitization has led many to declare a “death of distance” in science. This implies that, while
														search and discovery are still necessary, what influences us is not, itself, a function of its
														location. Consequently, citations, a primary policy metric, are assumed to be “placeless” such
														that, when scientists cite work, they simply acknowledge the contributions that influenced them.
														Nevertheless, a growing body of research argues that spatial distribution of science still matters,
														with distance affecting the probability of citation. However, this work relies on indirect measures
														of influence. Here, we present and deploy a direct measure of influence, derived from a survey
														of ~12,000 authors. Combining direct reporting of how authors were influenced by their references,
														authors’ institutional data, and geographic locations from the Google Maps API, we are able to
														measure the relationship between spatial distance and influence much more directly than previously
														possible.<br><i><b><u>Eamon Duede (UChicago)</b></u>, Misha Teplitskiy (Michigan), and Karim Lakhani (Harvard)</i></p>

												<p class="major">"How We Cite: Quality and Inequality in Science."</a><i><br><b>(Science of Science)</br></b></i></p>
												<p>Citations and metrics derived from them increasingly dictate all aspects of science, from what
													gets funded to who gets hired. But what do citations counts actually measure? Authors may cite
													for a variety of reasons, including purely rhetorical ones, but how these motives affect aggregate
													citation counts is poorly understood. Here, we use a large-scale survey of authors of scientific
													papers, asking them about specific citation decisions. Using responses from nearly 10K authors
													from all areas of science, we find that most citations are rhetorical in nature, and many are only
													skimmed. Authors "invest" reading effort primarily into famous papers, and end up being influenced
													primarily by them, whereas obscure papers are cited more rhetorically. An experiment embedded in
													 the survey shows that low citation counts cause scientists to perceive those papers as being of
													 lower quality. Taken together, the results suggest a model of reading and citing in which famous
													 papers matter even more than their already high citation counts indicate. <b>(In Review)</b>

													<p class="major">When Technology Transforms Society: Considering the Societal and Ethical Impacts of Quantum Computing and AI</a>.</p>
							<p>Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are currently making significant technical progress,
								with commensurate interest from the public, media outlets, funding agencies, and corporate partners.
								Stakeholders frequently point to the potential of these technologies to “transform society,” but what does this mean,
								practically? Should we, as researchers, anticipate the social, political, and ethical consequences of our work
								and steer our research programs accordingly? Can we draw from scholarship in the social sciences and the humanities
								to inform understanding of the distributional impacts of our programs? This workshop will explore these questions
								and develop collaborations across disciplines, institutions, and key stakeholders who may be able to help responsibly
								steer the evolution of these revolutionary technologies in ethical and socially beneficial ways.</p>
							<p>Co-Organized by Daniel Bowring (Fermilab), Chihway Chang (UChicago), <b><u>Eamon Duede (UChicago)</b></u>, and Brian Nord (Fermilab). Funding provided by
								the Center for Data and Computing at the University of Chicago and the Kavli Foundation</p>
