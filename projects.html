								My current work in philosophy is about epistemic trust in Artificial Intelligence in scientific contexts. I
								attempt to articulate the fundamental nature of epistemological challenges presented by the use of AI 
								and seek to specify what plausible and satisfying solutions might look like. My ongoing philosophical
								projects collectively aim at broadening and deepening our understanding of the unified and interrelated
								nature of the challenges for scientific trust in AI, proposing solutions, and articulating what this all means
								for the opportunities and benefits that AI has to offer science and society.</p>

		My current empirical work investigates the role of data science and artificial intelligence in enhancing the effectiveness and scalability of 
		innovative, data-driven, and algorithm-assisted operational frameworks. I also evaluate whether and when it is suitable for algorithms to function autonomously, 
		with or without human supervision. I am also concerned with the dynamics of discovery across disciplines, geographic space, and time. Here, I use the 
		computational techniques of 
		‘data science’ to study the flow of knowledge and influence between communities of experts and other audiences, and study
		how these can be catalyzed or stymied by institutional and technological factors.

			<p><b>AI-enabled Molecular Engineering of Materials and Systems (AIMEMS) for Sustainability</b><br>
			Molecular engineering is a dynamic and evolving field that applies molecular-level science in experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches to engineer advanced materials, processes, devices, and systems. Starting from molecular level concepts and principles offers exciting opportunities for targeted design and exquisite tuning of material/system properties for specific applications. Focusing on use-inspired research driven by sustainability will lead to substantial societal benefits. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that is rapidly transforming almost every aspect of society. By integrating AI with molecular engineering, this research traineeship will open new horizons for engineering complex, multifunctional materials, processes, and systems within a modern framework of sustainability, and will dramatically accelerate scientific discovery and technological innovation. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award will train a new generation of graduate student leaders at the frontiers of knowledge in AI-enabled molecular engineering of materials and systems for sustainability. The program funds twenty (20) students and intentionally integrates transferrable professional skills with interdisciplinary technical skills ranging from materials science to computer science and social science into the curricular design and thesis research projects. Through a strategic partnership with Argonne National Laboratory and with industrial collaborators, the program will further leverage world-class expertise and unique facilities to train students toward a range of research and research-related career pathways, both within and outside academia.

			<p><b>Latent Knowledge Capture on Covid-19 Literature</b><br>
			As the published (and preprint) literature on Covid-19 explodes, no individual researcher, team, or institution can cognitively process and understand what we now collectively know about this disease. Many connections and relationships between and across properties of the virus, its interaction with hosts, its transmission within populations, as well as health and economic outcomes are missed precisely because the expertise needed to make these connections spans otherwise disparate and cognitively disjoint disciplines (microbiology, virology, epidemiology, medicine, and public policy). As a result, we may know more about this disease than we are collectively aware. As the number of these “unknown knowns” piles up, we are missing opportunities for breakthroughs. This suggests the need for computational approaches to reveal the correlations latent in our collective understanding. However, because that understanding is codified as text (as opposed to, say, structured data), it lacks the kind of statistical tractability necessary for traditional machine learning approaches to modeling. Here I propose to develop novel unsupervised word embedding models to capture and extract knowledge about Covid-19 that is otherwise latent in and across the blooming literature.<br></p>

			<p><b>When Technology Transforms Society: Considering the Societal and Ethical Impacts of Quantum Computing and AI</b>
			Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are currently making significant technical progress,
				with commensurate interest from the public, media outlets, funding agencies, and corporate partners.
				Stakeholders frequently point to the potential of these technologies to “transform society,” but what does this mean,
				practically? Should we, as researchers, anticipate the social, political, and ethical consequences of our work
				and steer our research programs accordingly? Can we draw from scholarship in the social sciences and the humanities
				to inform understanding of the distributional impacts of our programs? This workshop will explore these questions
				and develop collaborations across disciplines, institutions, and key stakeholders who may be able to help responsibly
				steer the evolution of these revolutionary technologies in ethical and socially beneficial ways.</p>
