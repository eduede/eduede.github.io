							<h1>Research Projects</h1>
							<p class="major">At the University of Chicago, my work is focussed on accelarating science through simplifying and streamlining access to computational infrastructure.
                              Since the <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-chips-are-down-for-moore-s-law-1.19338">plateauing</a> of single core performance, exploiting parallelism is crucial to keep up with computing demands.
                              To this end, I've explored parallel programming models, high-performance distributed systems and marrying the two through Python based libraries.
                              A curated set of projects that fit this theme follow.

						<p class="major">"Being Together in Place as a Catalyst for Scientific Advance"</a><i><br><b>(Science of Science)</br></b></i></p>
						<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated social distancing at every level of society, including universities and research institutes, raising essential questions concerning the importance of proximity and place for scientific and scholarly advance. Using customized author surveys about the intellectual influence of specific referenced works on their own scientific papers, combined with precise geographic and semantic distances between focal and referenced works, we find that being at the same institution is strongly associated with intellectual influence on scientists’ published work. This influence increases with intellectual distance—the more different the work done by colleagues at your institution, the more influential it is on your own. For example, research that scientists discover through seminars is particularly intellectually distant from their own work. Universities worldwide constitute places where people doing very different work engage in sustained interactions through departments, committees, and communities that come to most influence their published research, suggesting the need to replace, rather than displace these diverse engagements for sustainable advance.<br><i><b><u>Eamon Duede (UChicago)</b></u>, Misha Teplitskiy (Michigan), and Karim Lakhani (Harvard)</i></p>
						<p class="major">"Deep Neural Networks and the Philosophy of Science"</a><i><br><b>(Philosophy of Science)</b></br></i></p>
						This paper argues that deep neural networks (DNNs) present the philosophy of
science with novel epistemological problems. This is shown by demonstrating that
DNNs are neither constructed on the basis of, nor do we have good reason to
believe that they encode scientic theories. This characteristic in conjunction with
their uninterpretability distinguishes the concerns raised by DNNs from those
which have already been examined by the literatures on models, computational
science, and simulations. As a result of their novelty, our understanding of the
relationship between science and knowledge is shown to be threatened by the use
of DNNs in science. <b>(In Review)</b><br><i><b><u>Eamon Duede (UChicago)</u></i></b></p>



												<p class="major">"Abduction Through Social Syllogisms and the Logic of Scientific Advance"</a><i><br><b>(Philosophy of Science)</b></br></i></p>
												<p>Here we argue that the production of novel scientific claims through the process of abduction, the historical province of philosophy, represents a critical scientific practice, central to scientific success and failure, and increasingly available to science studies through large-scale data. We re-scale abduction to show how it necessarily occurs through conversation between those who understand a particular
													scientific system and its anomalies—its priests—and those exposed to alien and disruptive patterns, theories,
													and findings that could resolve them—its prophets. We argue that these complex, extended conversations between
													those with divergent backgrounds define a social logic of discovery that yield speculative hypotheses with
													outsized impact across science.<br><i><b><u>Eamon Duede (UChicago)</u></b> and James Evans (UChicago)</i></p>

													<p class="major">"Distance Matters in Science and Scholarship"</a><i><br><b>(Science of Science)</br></b></i></p>
													<p>The effect of spatial distance on scientific discovery and innovation is a highly important policy
														issue. Yet, there is still significant debate concerning how space affects science. Ubiquitous
														digitization has led many to declare a “death of distance” in science. This implies that, while
														search and discovery are still necessary, what influences us is not, itself, a function of its
														location. Consequently, citations, a primary policy metric, are assumed to be “placeless” such
														that, when scientists cite work, they simply acknowledge the contributions that influenced them.
														Nevertheless, a growing body of research argues that spatial distribution of science still matters,
														with distance affecting the probability of citation. However, this work relies on indirect measures
														of influence. Here, we present and deploy a direct measure of influence, derived from a survey
														of ~12,000 authors. Combining direct reporting of how authors were influenced by their references,
														authors’ institutional data, and geographic locations from the Google Maps API, we are able to
														measure the relationship between spatial distance and influence much more directly than previously
														possible.<br><i><b><u>Eamon Duede (UChicago)</b></u>, Misha Teplitskiy (Michigan), and Karim Lakhani (Harvard)</i></p>

												<p class="major">"Status drives how we cite: Evidence from thousands of authors"</a><i><br><b>(Science of Science)</br></b></i></p>
												<p>Although citations are used extensively to measure the influence of research papers, only some citations denote substantial influence. We investigate the role that a paper’s citation status (citation count) plays in attracting citations that indicate substantial influence, i.e. strongly shape the manuscript, its inherent ideas and/or its approach. Using data on 17,154 specific citation decisions provided by 9,380 authors systematically sampled across 15 academic fields, we show that most citations have little-to-no influence on the focal manuscript. However, citations to high-status papers are 2-3 more likely than those to low-status papers to denote substantial influence. The relationship between status and influence is likely causal because status affects where researchers invest their attention. Using an embedded field experiment in our instrument, we show that researchers use citations as a heuristic for quality and infer that lightly cited papers are of relatively poor quality. Low perceived quality is in turn associated with being discovered too late in the project and read too superficially to influence key research choices. Overall, the advantages of high status extend not only to how often papers are cited but how meaningfully: a paper’s status changes researchers’ perceptions and drives attention to the most prominent papers. Consequently, because a higher proportion of their citations denote substantial influence, highly cited papers influence the research frontier to a much greater extent than even their raw citation counts suggest. <b>(In Review)</b>

													<p class="major">When Technology Transforms Society: Considering the Societal and Ethical Impacts of Quantum Computing and AI</a>.</p>
							<p>Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are currently making significant technical progress,
								with commensurate interest from the public, media outlets, funding agencies, and corporate partners.
								Stakeholders frequently point to the potential of these technologies to “transform society,” but what does this mean,
								practically? Should we, as researchers, anticipate the social, political, and ethical consequences of our work
								and steer our research programs accordingly? Can we draw from scholarship in the social sciences and the humanities
								to inform understanding of the distributional impacts of our programs? This workshop will explore these questions
								and develop collaborations across disciplines, institutions, and key stakeholders who may be able to help responsibly
								steer the evolution of these revolutionary technologies in ethical and socially beneficial ways.</p>
							<p>Co-Organized by Daniel Bowring (Fermilab), Chihway Chang (UChicago), <b><u>Eamon Duede (UChicago)</b></u>, and Brian Nord (Fermilab). Funding provided by
								the Center for Data and Computing at the University of Chicago and the Kavli Foundation</p>
